ðŸ”¢ Basic Calculator Web App using Streamlit

I built a simple, interactive calculator web application using Python and Streamlit. The app allows users to perform essential arithmetic operationsâ€”Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division, Modulus, and Floor Divisionâ€”in a clean and responsive UI.

âœ… Key Features:

Real-time number input with result display

Responsive buttons for each operation

Error handling for division by zero

Sidebar with title and branding image


âœ… This project demonstrates my skills in:

Building front-end interfaces with Streamlit

Handling user interaction and edge cases

Writing clean, functional Python code
